World Peace Catalyst Fund is an IT non-profit I created from a side project.  I made an Ai, semiotic mobile application, Icebreakers.  It reduces the communication barrier by 90% and uses the heart effect for safe, easy, heart based cross-cultural conversations.  I rationalize that in the way towards peace, the more we know about each other, the faster the peace will come and the only way for this is through cross-cultural conversations.  I created a systemic social mechanism that revolves around this application.  
In addition to a mobile application, I have an Instagram social media page to engage the public.   Since the application uses symbols for communication, I do a systemic study of symbols from different cultures around the world.  

Ai for Instagram page.
1.	It would be nice to have Ai generate symbols and their meanings from different cultures around the world.  There are 198 countries, each have their own culture and symbolism.  For example: Egyptian culture, Aztec culture, Incan culture, Mayan culture, etc…  These posts start on Instagram and people can like and comment on their meaning.  It then goes to a Facebook group where people can vote on which symbols hold higher value and can be a universal truth.
Ex: Greek Culture: Dolphin – ‘The dolphin is another symbol for the Greek Goddess Aphrodite.  Aphrodite is the ancient Greek Goddess of sexual love and beauty.  Her Roman equivalent is Venus.  Dolphins are known as the only other animals besides humans who have sex for pleasure.’ https://www.instagram.com/p/CP8TaZuspo-/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

Requirements:
a.	User must be able to input region, culture, website or civilization to gather symbols from
b.	Model must output a list of symbols and their meanings that have not been used yet
c.	For each symbol and their meaning, the model must generate an Instagram post with an AI generated image of the symbol and ai generated hastags and ai generated captions 
d.	Captions and hashtags must strike interest with the user, get them thinking about the meaning of the symbol, try to get the user to interact (like, comment, share, repost, save) 
e.	Captions should try and get users to engage in thinking about the meaning of this symbol and whether it is a universal truth or not.
f.	The posts should be themed and stylized per culture.  Please see current Instagram page for details.  If coding a themed template is difficult, a themed template should be loaded to the model and the model should post the image on the template 




2.	The posts on the Instagram page are also of Philosophy pertaining to peace.  If an Ai program can generate posts that get people thinking about peace. Ex: ‘Peace is always beautiful’ – Walt Whitman (American Poet).  Literature should be filled with these, the religious texts should also have similar quotes/verses pertaining to peace.

Requirements:
a.	User must be able to input either nothing, or a book, person (philosopher, leader, etc) or time period
b.	Model must output a list of quotes and their origins from the input, if no input, then the model should generate a quote from current context of conflict in general news sources.  The quotes must not have been used before
c.	For each quote and their source, the model must generate an Instagram post with an AI generated image of the quote, source and ai generated hastags and ai generated captions
d.	Captions and hashtags must strike interest with the user, get them thinking about the meaning of the quote, try to get the user to interact (like, comment, share, repost, save) 
e.	Captions should try and get users to enagage in thinking about the meaning of this quote and try to get the users to say the quotes in their everyday use



3.	Ai to generate posts about conflicts around the world. Posts should be insightful, spark empathy and get people to think what if it happened here, we should be more mindful of our actions.  Things that get people thinking more about what they can do for peace.

b.	Model must output a list of facts, generally about 5 for each conflict region. The facts must not have been used before.
c.	For each fact and their source, the model must generate an Instagram post with an AI generated image of the fact, source and ai generated hastags and ai generated captions
d.	Captions and hashtags must strike interest with the user, get them thinking about the reasoning of the conflict, how it can be mitigated, how common grounds would lessen the severity of the conflict, and try to get the user to interact (like, comment, share, repost, save) 
e.	Captions should try and get users to engage in thinking about the meaning of life, common grounds, how they can avoid such a conflict in the future and try to get them to see the importance of using icebreakers to establish common grounds 


4.	Society building – Ai for posts about society building. Bonds of society and other things that get people geared toward thinking about how to peacefully engage. https://www.instagram.com/p/C7v7lHvuJzr/

c.	For each item in the list, the model must generate an Instagram post with an AI generated image representation of the item, and ai generated hastags and ai generated captions
d.	Captions and hashtags must strike interest with the user, get them thinking about the item, how common grounds would lessen the severity of conflict, bonds of society and interacting cross-culturally and try to get the user to interact (like, comment, share, repost, save)

6.	As part of the cross-cultural conversations program, users will converse with each other in their respective languages over the meanings of their image feed in their conversation.  The conversations should be at least 3 texts from each user and the image feed should be at least 200 images.  Each conversation will have a list of non-unique demographic identifiers for each user.   A model will be needed to accept the texts and image feed and will need to identify if the users were able to come up with a bond of society or if there was nothing useful in the exchange.  A bond of society is defined as a concept, ideas, exchange that either brings people together or separates them.  The users will identify which images heiroglyphed to them the ideas/concept or exchange.  The model will need to categorize the bond of society along with the country pairing and non-unique demographic identifiers.  Once a configurable threshold has been reached, say 1000 conversations has been reached, the model will need to categorize the conversations and resulting bonds of society for common themes.  A common theme is formed when a bond of society has at least 4 conversations supporting it.  Once a common theme is identified, the model will need to create a few Instagram posts per the theme.  Two-Three posts will be a collage of images from the image feed and texts representing the common theme.  Two-Three posts will be an ai representation of the common theme.
